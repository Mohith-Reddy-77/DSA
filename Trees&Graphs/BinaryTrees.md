# Binary Trees

> This entire chapter will make heavy use of recursion. If you aren't comfortable with recursion, please review recursion before continuing.

## Nodes and Graphs

In this chapter, we will be learning about trees and graphs, which is probably the most common type of interview question (hash maps aren't really a "type" of question, and "array" or "string" is too broad). Trees and graphs are abstract data structures that show up everywhere in both the physical world and the software world. This is the longest chapter of the course, but for good reason. A huge amount of interview problems give trees or graphs as the input, and the entire problem is focused on them. As such, it is crucial that anyone going into a coding interview has a strong understanding of them.

Let's start by revisiting what a node is. We looked at nodes in the linked lists chapter - recall that a node is an abstract data type with two things. First, a node stores data. This data can be whatever you want - an integer, a boolean, a hash map, your own custom objects, or all of the above. Second, a node stores pointers to other nodes.

A graph is any collection of nodes and their pointers to other nodes. In fact, linked lists and trees are both types of graphs. As a topic, graphs are extremely broad. There is an entire field of study dedicated to graphs called graph theory.

Even though a tree is a type of graph, trees and graphs are considered different topics when it comes to algorithm problems. Because graphs are the more advanced/difficult topic, we will start by looking at trees.

> The nodes of a graph are also called vertices, and the pointers that connect them are called edges. In graphical representations, nodes/vertices are usually represented with circles and the edges are lines/arrows that connect the circles (we saw this in the linked lists chapter).

## What is a Tree ?

Like a linked list, a tree is a type of graph. Also like a linked list, there are multiple types of trees. In this course, we will be focusing on binary trees. Let's take a look at what a binary tree is.

> Recall that the start of a linked list was called the head. The start of a binary tree is called the root.

In a linked list, a node's pointer pointed to the **next** node. In a tree, a node has pointers to its **children**. If a node A is pointing to a node B, then B is a child of A, and A is the parent of B. The root is the only node that has no parent. Note that in a tree, a node cannot have more than one parent.

So what makes a binary tree "binary"? In a binary tree, all nodes have a maximum of two children. These children are referred to as the left child and the right child. Note that there isn't really a difference between a child being on the left or the right, it's just the convention used to refer to the children and convenient for graphical representations.

To summarize, a binary tree is a collection of nodes. Every node has between 0 to 2 children, and every node except the root has exactly one parent.

Trees (not just binary trees) are implemented all around us in real life. Some examples:

Here is an example of a binary tree:

1. File systems
2. A comment thread on an app like Reddit or Twitter
3. A company's organization chart

In each of these examples, the respective root nodes and children would be:

1. The root directory, and subfolders/files
2. The original post/tweet, and the comments and replies
3. The CEO, and direct reports

## Tree Terminology

There is some tree-specific terminology that you will need to learn.

The root node is the node at the "top" of the tree. Every node in the tree is accessible starting from the root node. In most tree questions, the root of the tree will be given as the input, just like how in linked lists, the head was given as the input.

If you have a node A with an edge to a node B, so A -> B, we call A the parent of node B, and node B a child of node A.

If a node has no children, it is called a leaf node. The leaf nodes are the leaves of the tree.
The depth of a node is how far it is from the root node. The root has a depth of 0. Every child has a depth of parentsDepth + 1, so the root's children have a depth of 1, their children have a depth of 2, and so on.

Lastly, perhaps the most important thing to understand: a subtree of a tree is a node and all its descendants. Trees are recursive - you can treat a subtree as if it was its own tree with the chosen node being the root. What do we mean by this? Let's look at the company example again. The entire company is represented by the tree rooted at the CEO. But what if we only cared about the engineering department? Let's say the CTO has a direct report who is an SVP (Senior Vice President) of engineering, and all engineers are under this person. Take this SVP, and separate them from the rest of the company (remove their connection to the CTO). What are you left with? It's still a valid tree, but now the SVP is the root! This subtree now represents the engineering department instead of the entire company. This is the most fundamental idea for solving tree problems - you can take any given node and treat it as its own tree, which allows you to solve problems in a recursive manner.

To illustrate the concept of a subtree, take a look at the following image:

## Code Representation

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left, right):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

In binary tree problems, you will be given a reference to the root of a binary tree as the input. You can access the root's left subtree with root.left and the root's right subtree with root.right. Like with linked lists, each node will also carry a value val as data. In a linked list, the tail (last node) has its next pointer as null. In a binary tree, if a node does not have a left child, then node.left will be null, and vice-versa with the right child. Remember that if both children are null, then the node is a leaf.
